!!! MODIFY YOUR build_go to use a local folder for your database.

This is under construction.
TODOs:

- need to make a better way manage the local storage
- need to make makefile to collect all the little shell scripts.

Notes.
- clone the repo
- modify build_go; make sure you use a local store path and a image name that make sense to you
- NOTE: if you change the name of the app, the scripts must also be changed. (yes, I need a more robust solution)


Application Notes.
